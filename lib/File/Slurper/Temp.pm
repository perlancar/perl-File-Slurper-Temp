# ABSTRACT: File::Slurper + File::Temp

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use L<File::Slurper>'s C<write_text> or C<write_binary>:

 use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text write_binary);
 write_text("/tmp/foo.txt", "some text");
 write_binary("/tmp/bar", $somedata);

Use C<write_text_to_tempfile> and C<write_binary_to_tempfile>:

 use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text_to_tempfile write_binary_to_tempfile);
 my $filename1 = write_text_to_tempfile("some text");
 my $filename2 = write_binary_to_tempfile($somedata);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a simple combination of L<File::Slurper> and L<File::Temp>. It
provides L</write_text> and L</write_binary> (as well as a couple of functions
of its own). The two functions are the same as their original in File::Slurper
but they will first write to a temporary file created by L<File::Temp>'s
C<tempfile>, then C<rename()> the temporary file to the originally specified
name. If the filename is originally a symlink, it will be replaced with a
regular file by C<rename()>. This can avoid symlink attack.

In addition to that, this module also provides L/<write_text_to_tempfile> and
L<write_binary_to_tempfile>. You don't have to specify filename but just content
to write and the functions will return the temporay filename created.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 write_text

Usage:

 write_text($filename, $content [ , $encoding, $crlf ])

Just like the original L<File::Slurper>'s version, except will write to
temporary file created by L<File::Temp>'s C<tempfile> first, then rename the
temporary file using C<rename()>. The function will croak if C<rename()> fails.

To make sure that C<rename()> doesn't fail when the default temporary directory
(e.g. C</tmp>) is on a different filesystem (because C<rename()> does not work
across filesystem boundary), the temporary file is created with option C<< DIR
=> dirname($filename) >> . If you want to set a specific temporary directory,
set C<$FILE_TEMP_DIR> (see source code).

=head2 write_binary

Usage:

 write_binary($filename, $content)

=head2 write_text_to_tempfile

Usage:

 $tempname = write_text_to_tempfile($content [ , $encoding, $crlf ])

Temporary file is created with default option (C<File::Temp::tempfile()>).

=head2 write_binary_to_tempfile

Usage:

 $tempname = write_binary_to_tempfile($content)
