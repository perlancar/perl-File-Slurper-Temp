# ABSTRACT: File::Slurper + File::Temp

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use like you would use L<File::Slurper>'s C<write_text> and C<write_binary>:

 use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text write_binary);
 write_text("/tmp/foo.txt", "some text");
 write_binary("/tmp/bar", $somedata);

Use C<write_text_to_tempfile> and C<write_binary_to_tempfile>:

 use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text_to_tempfile write_binary_to_tempfile);
 my $filename1 = write_text_to_tempfile("some text");
 my $filename2 = write_binary_to_tempfile($somedata);

This module also provides L</modify_text> and L</modify_binary>, like that
provided by L<File::Slurper::Shortcuts>:

 use File::Slurper::Temp qw(write_text_to_tempfile write_binary_to_tempfile);
 modify_text("/path/to/file.txt", sub { s/foo/bar/g });
 modify_binary("/path/to/file.txt", sub { s/foo/bar/g });


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a simple combination of L<File::Slurper> and L<File::Temp>. It
provides its version of L</write_text> and L</write_binary>, as well as a couple
of functions of its own.

This module's version of C<write_text> and C<write_binary> write to temporary
file first using L<File::Temp>'s L<tempfile()|File::Temp/tempfile> before
renaming to the final destination path using Perl's L<rename()|perlfunc/rename>.
If the destination path is originally a symlink, it will be replaced with a
regular file by C<rename()>. This can avoid symlink attack.

In addition the above two functions, this module also provides
L</write_text_to_tempfile> and L</write_binary_to_tempfile>. You don't have to
specify destination path but just content to write, and the functions will
return the temporary filename created.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 write_text

Usage:

 write_text($filename, $content [ , $encoding, $crlf ])

Just like the original L<File::Slurper>'s version, except will write to
temporary file created by L<File::Temp>'s C<tempfile> first, then rename the
temporary file using Perl's C<rename()>. The function will croak if C<rename()>
fails.

By default, the temporary file is created in the same directory as C<$filename>,
using C<tempfile()>'s option C<< DIR => dirname($filename) >>. If you want to
set a specific temporary directory, set L</"$FILE_TEMP_DIR">. But
keep in mind that C<rename()> doesn't work cross-device.

By default, if the target file exists, the temporary file is also created with
the same permission as the target file. Otherwise, permission is default as per
File::Temp's default (0600). If you want to set a specific permission, set
L</"$FILE_TEMP_PERMS">. Permission setting is done by File::Temp::tempfile()
using its PERMS option.

By default, file ownership is not changed/set. If you run this script as root,
you might be creating files owned by root. There's no option yet to set this.

=head2 write_binary

Usage:

 write_binary($filename, $content)

=head2 write_text_to_tempfile

Usage:

 $tempname = write_text_to_tempfile($content [ , $encoding, $crlf ])

Temporary file is created with default option (C<File::Temp::tempfile()>).

=head2 write_binary_to_tempfile

Usage:

 $tempname = write_binary_to_tempfile($content)

=head2 modify_text

Like L<File::Slurper::Shortcuts>'s C<modify_text> except it uses our version of
L</write_text>.

See File::Slurper::Shortcuts for more details.

=head2 modify_binary

Like L<File::Slurper::Shortcuts>'s C<modify_binary> except it uses our version
of L</write_binary>.

See File::Slurper::Shortcuts for more details.
